        <h3>Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. It aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.</p>
        <p>SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.</p>
        <h4>Let's dive into the six phases of the SDLC:</h4>
        <h5>Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h5>
        <p>Business requirements are gathered in this phase. This phase is the main focus of the project managers and stake holders. Meetings with managers, stake holders and users are held in order to determine the requirements like; who is going to use the system? How will they use the system? What data should be input into the system? What data should be output by the system? These are general questions that get answered during a requirements gathering phase. After requirement gathering these requirements are analyzed for their validity and the possibility of incorporating the requirements in the system to be development is also studied.</p>
        <h5>System Design</h5>
        <p>In this phase the system and software design is prepared from the requirement specifications which were studied in the first phase. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture. The system design specifications serve as input for the next phase of the model.</p>
        <h5>Implementation / Coding</h5>
        <p>On receiving system design documents, the work is divided into modules/units and actual coding is started. The system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality which is referred to as Unit Testing.</p>
        <h5>Testing</h5>
        <p>After the code is developed, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the product is actually solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements phase. During this phase all types of functional testing like unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done as well as non-functional testing are also done.</p>
        <h5>Deployment</h5>
        <p>After successful testing the product is delivered / deployed to the customer for their use. As soon as the product is given to the customers they will first do the beta testing. If any changes they will suggest it to the organization. The product may be released as it is or with suggested enhancements in the targeting market segment. After the product is released in the market, its maintenance is done for the existing customer base.</p>
        <h5>Maintenance</h5>
        <p>There are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues patches are released. Also to enhance the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.</p>
        <p>All these phases are cascaded to each other in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases. The next phase is started only after the defined set of goals are achieved for previous phase and it is signed off, so the name "Waterfall Model". In this model phases do not overlap.</p>
        <p>Understanding the SDLC is crucial for any software engineer, as it provides the structure and order needed to ensure that the software development process is smooth and efficient.</p>
