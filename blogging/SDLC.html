        <h1>Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle</h1>
        <p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the process used by organizations to build an application from its inception to its end. This process is used by industry professionals to design, develop and test high-quality software.</p>

        <h2>Phases of SDLC</h2>
        <h3>1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis</h3>
        <p>All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in this phase. These requirements are analyzed for their validity and the possibility of incorporating them into the system to be developed.</p>

        <h3>2. Design</h3>
        <p>In this phase, the system and software design is prepared from the requirement specifications which were studied in the first phase. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining the overall system architecture.</p>

        <h3>3. Implementation / Coding</h3>
        <p>On receiving system design documents, the work is divided into modules/units and actual coding is started. The system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated into the next phase.</p>

        <h3>4. Testing</h3>
        <p>After the code is developed, it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the product is solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements phase.</p>

        <h3>5. Deployment</h3>
        <p>After successful testing, the product is delivered/deployed to the customer for their use.</p>

        <h3>6. Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Once when the customers start using the developed system, then the actual problems come up and need to be solved from time to time. This process, where the care is taken for the developed product, is known as maintenance.</p>

        <p>Understanding the SDLC is crucial for any software engineer, as it provides the structure and order needed to ensure that the software development process is smooth and efficient.</p>
